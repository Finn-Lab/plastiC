# plastiC
A Snakemake workflow for recovery and characterization of plastid genomes from metagenomic datasets.

# Installation
1. Install Snakemake into a conda environment. 
2. Clone repository 
# Databases
plastiC requires databases for CAT and Uniprot (for completeness estimates). 

# Configuration

# Running

# Output
For each sample, three dictories will be created: `logs`, `working` and `plastids`. Final outputs regarding
plastid information can be found in the `plastids` directory. The `working` directory contains intermediate files
from analyses required for identification and characterziation of plastid genomes but can be removed if users desire.
